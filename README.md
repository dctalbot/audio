# Web Audio API fun

If you've ever wanted to listen to the most primitive sound of raw data possible, this repo is for you. I wrote a nice little React hook (see [`useTone.ts`](./src/lib/useTone.ts)) over the platform audio API. Then I used it to put together a small ensemble of intruments: a keyboard, a trombone, and a theremin. Enjoy!
